# 📝 Changes Summary - System Updates

## 🎯 What Was Changed

Based on your requirements, I've completely updated the system with two major changes:

### 1. ✅ Authentication System Overhaul

**Before:**
- JWT token-based authentication
- Static admin credentials in code

**After:**
- ✅ **Session-based authentication** (no JWT tokens)
- ✅ **Root user** credentials in `.env` file
- ✅ **User Management UI** - Root can add/edit users from dashboard
- ✅ **Email-based login** instead of username
- ✅ **Password hashing** with bcrypt
- ✅ **User database** in `server/data/users.json`

### 2. ✅ AWS S3 Dynamic Storage

**Before:**
- Files saved to local filesystem
- Static game-data.json file

**After:**
- ✅ **All files uploaded to AWS S3**
- ✅ **Dynamic game-data.json** fetched from S3
- ✅ **CloudFront integration** support
- ✅ **Real-time S3 updates** on every upload/edit
- ✅ **No local file storage** (everything in cloud)

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Backend `.env` File

You must configure these in `server/.env`:

```env
# Root User - Change these!
ROOT_USERNAME=root
ROOT_EMAIL=root@admin.com
ROOT_PASSWORD=root123

# AWS S3 - Required!
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name

# CloudFront (if using)
CLOUDFRONT_URL=https://your-cloudfront-domain.cloudfront.net
```

### Frontend `.env` File

Create in dashboard root:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

---

## 🎮 How to Use

### As Root User

1. **Login:**
   - Email: From `.env` (`ROOT_EMAIL`)
   - Password: From `.env` (`ROOT_PASSWORD`)

2. **Manage Users:**
   - Go to "User Management" (only visible to root)
   - Add users with email and password
   - Users can then login and upload games

3. **Upload Games:**
   - Go to "Upload Game"
   - Fill game details
   - Upload files (they go to S3)
   - game-data.json in S3 is auto-updated

### As Regular User

1. **Login:**
   - Email: Provided by root admin
   - Password: Provided by root admin

2. **Upload Games:**
   - Same as root user
   - All uploads go to S3

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

### Old Workflow (Local Files)
```
Upload → Local filesystem → game-data.json file
```

### New Workflow (AWS S3)
```
Upload → AWS S3 → game-data.json in S3 → CloudFront CDN
```

---

## 📊 File Storage Locations

### Old System
```
gamingPortal/public/
├── games/        ← Local folder
├── thumbnail/    ← Local folder
├── gif/          ← Local folder
└── game-data.json ← Local file
```

### New System (S3)
```
s3://your-bucket/
└── public/
    ├── games/        ← S3 folder
    ├── thumbnail/    ← S3 folder
    ├── gif/          ← S3 folder
    └── game-data.json ← S3 file (dynamic)
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Configure AWS S3

1. Create S3 bucket
2. Create folders: `public/games/`, `public/thumbnail/`, `public/gif/`
3. Create empty `public/game-data.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "games": []
   }
   ```
4. Set bucket policy for public read access
5. Get AWS credentials (Access Key + Secret)

### Step 2: Update `.env` Files

1. Edit `server/.env` with AWS credentials and root user
2. Create dashboard `.env` with API URL

### Step 3: Install & Start

```bash
# Backend
cd server
npm install
npm start

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd ..
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Login & Use

1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with root credentials
3. Add users via User Management
4. Upload games (they go to S3)

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Before (JWT)
```
Login → JWT Token → Store in localStorage → Send with each request
```

### After (Session)
```
Login → Session created → Cookie sent → Server validates session
```

---

## 👥 User Management

### Root User
- **Location:** `server/.env` file
- **Access:** Full control, can't be deleted
- **Can Do:** Everything + manage users

### Regular Users
- **Location:** `server/data/users.json`
- **Created By:** Root user via dashboard
- **Can Do:** Upload games, edit game data

---

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### Session Authentication
✅ Simpler (no token management)  
✅ More secure (server-side sessions)  
✅ Auto-expiry (24 hours)  
✅ Easy logout  

### AWS S3 Storage
✅ Scalable (unlimited storage)  
✅ Fast (CloudFront CDN)  
✅ Reliable (99.999999999% durability)  
✅ No local disk space needed  
✅ Easy backups  

### User Management
✅ Root admin always has access  
✅ Add team members easily  
✅ Role-based permissions  
✅ Password security (bcrypt hashing)  

---

## 📦 Dependencies Added

### Backend
- `express-session` - Session management
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - AWS S3 client
- `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` - S3 multipart uploads

### Removed
- `jsonwebtoken` - No longer using JWT

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't login as root | Check `ROOT_EMAIL` and `ROOT_PASSWORD` in `server/.env` |
| AWS upload fails | Verify AWS credentials and S3 bucket exists |
| game-data.json not found | Create empty `public/game-data.json` in S3 |
| Session expires | Normal after 24 hours, login again |
| User can't be added | Only root user can add users |
